- SPU. 
Currently in CBM_dataPrep_SK.r, SPUs for Canada are read from a shape file (spUnit_Locator.shp) that I think was created by Ian Eddy. We need to make this more generalized.
- Discuss with Ben storing this "base" spatial layers on the cloud somewhere so we can all know we are using the same layers. The current PSPU data is here: \\vic-fas2\cat\NFCMARS_admin\Data\SpatialFramework\PSPUS.zip 
- Scott put that same shapefile on a googleDrive here is a link to PSPUS.zip
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z_pMwhylqMkKZfOArATaAz9pUVNXtBAd/view?usp=sharing
- I need to compare those two files. LandR::.compareCRS?

- Default parameters. 
Get the CBM_default to read the same database as Scott's work. The parameters are mostly the same as our defaults, this batch of parameters is extracted from the most recent public release of the CBM-CFS3 toolbox, since around 2016 there are have been a few updates to the archive index and it's possible temperatures, new disturbances, and possibly DM revisions will be the differences from the version you have. Things like volume to biomass parameters have also changed but that's not relevant to cbm_exn. The db file source I have been working with is here:
https://github.com/cat-cfs/libcbm_py/tree/master/libcbm/resources/cbm_defaults_db
I also have scripts to generate that same database schema from any CBM3 archive index. I imagine this is a similar schema to the one you have, but I honestly cannot remember that. (can share if interested)
For the parameters from here: https://github.com/cat-cfs/libcbm_py/tree/cbm_exn/libcbm/model/cbm_exn/parameters
These are different from the old parameters because:
1 the disturbance matrix values have been adjusted to only have the single biomass and snag pools (SW Merch, HW Merch is now just "Merch")
2 decay parameters drop hw and sw specific snag parameters (they were identical)
3 turnover parameters carry a sw/hw column, meaning each row is specific to a spuid,sw_hw combination
4 flux.json - carries fluxes without hw/sw pools

- the masterRaster is not quite 30m. Need to figure out where the original raster came from and fix it.

- the default sql bd is not copied in the CBM_vol2biomass.R module. It will need to be if this is to be run independently.

- there were some code changes in the first pass of building spadesCBM. THey are listed here G:\RES_Work\Work\SpaDES\spadesCBM. Need to check if these are fixed in new default data

- some NaNs are created in the sim$ecozone raster. Need to figure out why.
