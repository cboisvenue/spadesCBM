The spadesCBMdefaults module reads all the default parameters and disturbance matrices for running the spadesCBM family of modules. 
CBM-CFS3 science was re-written by Scott Morken, a programmer for the development of CBM-CFS3 which runs in an MSAccess framework. Scott used R and wrapped C++ functions to emulate what happens in CBM-CFS3. This module (spadesCBMdefaults) reads-in teh parameters for use in the other two modules, spadesCBMinputs and spadesCBMcore.
An SQLite database is required to run this module (data\cbm_defaults\cbm_defaults.db) as well as a series of sql scripts to extract the parameters from the database. Both the database and the sql scripts are provided in the spadesCBMdefaults data folder (github\spadesCBM\spadesCBMdefaults\data\cbm_defaults) which, unlike the main data folder in the family of modules (github\spadesCBM\data) is not in .gitIgnore. The database corresponds to the 2018 version of the CBM-CFS3 Archive Index. No updates are provided since all parameters are accessible and changeable through the R environment.
This module runs independently of the other two modules in the spadesCBM family (spadesCBMinputs, spadesCBMcore).
