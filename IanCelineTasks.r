# Creating maps from outputs
#We have a table "level3DT", that has a unique pixel groups We need to be able
#to make maps with this output maps per year and per pools or combinations of
#pools 
#Status: There was discussion of making sure "standindex" column in the
#output1stand.csv (in outputs folder) matched the pixel groups. And apparently
#Ian wrote code about this but Celine can't find it










# Oct.17,2018
# Disturbances
# Status: a bogus table of disturbances where the same disturbance type was applied to
# each pixel group worked.
# Next: we need to try one of the rasters from Wulder and White used in Boisvenue et al 2016
# Ian, where are these? are they cut-up to size for the test area?
# Next: modifying the level3DT after each disturbance...
# do we follow what LandR-biomass does?
# Discussion needed



# Less pressing
# spu locator map
# create a cbm-default spu map (raster) and give the user the change to manually
# (on a map) or with coordinates to determine which spu they are in
