# Overview

The theme here is "Transparency, flexibility and science improvement in CFS carbon modelling". 

## Background
In summer 2017 Scott Morken wrote a second incarnation of a CBM-like R-based carbon model in an intensive 2-week stint with EMcIntire and CBoisvenue. The code and scripts, including the calls to Cpp via RCpp, are all contained in RunSK_new.R. This emulates the science in CBM-CFS3 but works in matrix operations (the original CBM-CFS3 does not). Scott got a spin up working with a comparison for 1 stand in SK, which he ran for 100 years post spin-up in both CBMCFS3 and the script as developed here. Results are the same compared to classic CBMCFS3 (see C:\Celine\GitHub\RCBM\data\12_Spades_run\CBM3BaselineTesting). A map of the links and functions of the R and cpp code (created by CBoisvenue) is avaible here (G:\RES_Work\Work\SpaDES\work\RCBMoverview\June2017CBMcore\cbmCoreMap.xlsx).


# Three-module family
One SpaDES module was developped to run the exact same script as RunSK-new.R. This SpaDES module is called carb1. There is a tagged version of it exists on the private github repo https://github.com/smorken/RCBM. (now in https://github.com/cboisvenue/RCBM)

The SpaDES module carb1 ("simple" rendition of RunSK_new.R into SapDES) was separated into three spadesCBM-family modules: spadesCBMdefaults, spadesCBMinputs, and spadesCBMcore. These are three child modules that are run by the present spadesCBM parent module. These are in the master branch here: https://github.com/cboisvenue/spadesCBM.git

The two first modules have a parsing file (the R file that has all the functions - spadesCBMdefaultFunctions.r, spadesCBMinputsFunctions.r). 
spadesCBMdefaultFunctions.r has r-language functions to build and query the S4 object cbmData. spadesCBMinputsFunctions.r, has r-language hashing functions and calls on the library "CBMVolumeToBiomass". This library was build by Scott Morken to apply the Boudewyn et al stand-level parameters to growth curve information for a translation into biomass pools. This library needs to be already built before running this module.
spadesCBMcoreFunctions.r compiles the Rcpp code in .InputObjects of spadesCBMcore.R (it has no parsing file). The compiled code is cached in the cache directory  `cacheDir = cachePath(sim), env = envir(sim)`

Many details of this three-modules family are in G:\RES_Work\Work\SpaDES\spadesCBM\Prezi WIN spadesCBM modules ov.exe

### spadesCBMdefaults 
This module has one event (init) and does not schedule anything else. It requires the "dbPath" and "sqlDir" to run. This present .rmd file creates "dbPath" and "sqlDir" (see below) and so does the .InputObjects section of spadesCBMdefault.R so that the spadesCBMdefault can run independently from the two other modules or from this parent module. This module loads all the CBM-CFS3 default parameters (Canadian defaults that is akin to the ArchiveIndex access database in CBM-CFS3). It is read as an S4 object called cbmData. This object has the following slot names "turnoverRates" (15byb13 full), "rootParameters" (48by7 full), "decayParameters" (11X6 full), "spinupParameters"(48by4 full), "classifierValues"(0X0), "climate" (48by2 full - mean annual temp), "spatialUnitIds" (48by3 full), "slowAGtoBGTransferRate"(1by1 0.006), "biomassToCarbonRate"(1by1 0.5),"ecoIndices" (0by0), "spuIndices" (0by0), "stumpParameters" (48by5 full), "overmatureDeclineParameters" (48by4 full), "disturbanceMatrix" (426X3 - character matrix with word descriptions of disturbances ["id" "name" "description"]). The whole sqlite db that contains the defaults is read/accessible via C:\Celine\GitHub\spadesCBM\exploringCode\readInSQLiteData.r.

### spadesCBMinputs
This module has one event (init) and does not schedule anything else. This module reads in information that is expected to be provided by the user: the growth curves, the ages of the stands/pixels, links between each stand and the growth curves, and where these stands are in Canada (which provides a link to the default parameters read-in by the previous module). It translates the m3/ha into the biomass pools and carbon curve using the CBMVolumeToBiomass.dll (by Scott Morken) which is done using the Boudewyn et al. stand-level parameters (this will eventually be a separate module for transparency). The CBMVolumeToBiomass library needs to already by built to run this module. This module will read-in spatially explicit data (eventually). It reads-in min and max rotation lentghts, mean fire return interval, provided a place for regeneragtion delays, and this is the place where you will tell the model where you are (which ecozone and spatial unit). The disturbance events also go in here (what and what date).

## spadesCBMcore
This module completes the simulations of the spadesCBM. It has five events: spinup, postSpinup, saveSpinup, annual, and savePools, with the saveSpinup being optional. The spinup event is in the init, and it runs the traditional spinup similarly to CBM-CFS3 where each stand is disturbed using the "historicDMIDs" and re-grown using the provided growth curves, until the DOM pools "fill-up" and stabilize.  A user can set a minimun and a maximum number of rotations, and the disturbance return interval ("minRotations", "maxRotations", "returnIntervals" set in the spadesCBMinput module) for the spinup. Once the DOM pools have stabilized, the spinup event growths the stand (still using the same growth curve) to the user-provided age of that stand/pixel ("ages" created in spadesCBMinputs module). If spinupDebug is set to FALSE, the spinup event provides a line for each stand with the intial pool values to initialize the stands/pixels for the annual simulations. These are assigned in postSpinup event. In the postSpinup event, matrices are set up for the processes that will happen in the annual event. The annual event is where all the processes are applied and the savePools event is scheduled last to save a .csv of the final pool values.

### DANGER with the spinupDebug parameter
The spinupDebug parameter is a logical parameter defined in the metadata of this module (in spadesCBMcore.R). It determines if the results from the spinup will be saved as an external file. The default is FALSE. If this is set to TRUE, the postSpinup event re-runs the cpp Sinup function because the cpp Spinup function actually uses the sinpupDebug and spits-out all the runs of for all the stands until the stabilization of the DOM pools instead of the DOM for each stand needed to start the annual simulation runs. This could take a long time if you have a lot of stands/pixels. This can be changed later, it was a work around to get these modules running. 

## Known Errors carried over from carb1
Error in Spinup(pools = sim$pools, opMatrix = opMatrix, constantProcesses = sim$processes,  : 
  Expecting a single value: [extent=0].
This is because the pooldef values are expected to be in the .GlobalEnv due to a function inside RCMBGrowthIncrements.cpp . That file should be changed so it is not looking in .GlobalEnv. Current work around is to place all the pooldef values in .GlobalEnv. This happens inside the ".inputObjects" function.

# Usage

```{r module_usage}
library(SpaDES)

setPaths(modulePath = "C:/Ian/Boisvenue/spadesCBM/",
        inputPath = "C:/Ian/Boisvenue/spadesCBM/data",
        outputPath = "C:/Ian/Boisvenue/spadesCBM/outputs",
        cachePath = "C:/Ian/Boisvenue/spadesCBM/cache"
        )

times <- list(start = 1990.00, end = 1999.00)
parameters <- list(
  spadesCBMcore = list(.useCache = FALSE),
  spadesCBMinputs = list(.useCache = FALSE),
  spadesCBMdefaults = list(.useCache = FALSE)
)

modules <- list("spadesCBM")
objects <- list(
  dbPath = file.path(inputDir,"cbm_defaults","cbm_defaults.db"),
  sqlDir = file.path(inputDir,"cbm_defaults")
  )

spadesCBMSim <- simInit(times = times, params = parameters, 
                    modules = modules,
                 objects = objects, paths = paths)

spadesCBMout <- spades(spadesCBMSim,debug=TRUE)
```

# Events

Describe what happens for each event type. There are 4 events.
Init
Init event reads in all the old cbmcfs3 parameters (similar to taking what is needed from the "Archive Index"). It also creates constant matrices using those parameters from the cbm_default.db files. For now, this also reads-in and processes the growth curves by gcid and spatial unit. This event adds to the sim environment:
- pooldef: names of all the pools that also have a memory spot saved in teh .Globals right now
- cbmdata: an S4 object that has the following slot names "turnoverRates" (15byb13 full), "rootParameters" (48by7 full), "decayParameters" (11X6 full), "spinupParameters"(48by4 full), "classifierValues"(0X0), "climate" (48by2 full - mean annual temp), "spatialUnitIds" (48by3 full), "slowAGtoBGTransferRate"(1by1 0.006), "biomassToCarbonRate"(1by1 0.5),"ecoIndices" (0by0), "spuIndices" (0by0), "stumpParameters" (48by5 full), "overmatureDeclineParameters" (48by4 full), "disturbanceMatrix" (217X3 - full - word descriptions linked to id...this is just saskatchewan I think), "disturbanceMatrixAssociation" (4642by3 full - type of matrix with matrix id), "disturbanceMatrixValues" , "disturbanceMatrixIndices" (), "disturbanceEvents", "landclasses", "pools", "domPools".          
- allMatrices: return the matrix ids of the loaded matrices
- decayRates: matrix 48X12 - holds the decay rates for all the dom pools (11 of them) per spatial unit
- carbonCurve: this is the result from using all the growth curves and "translating" them into biomass compartments using SMorken's CBMVolumeToBiomass library and its function VolumeToBiomassConvert(). This is one of the components that will need to be made into an independent module and more transparent
- growth_increments: not convinced we need this to be in the sim environment...but, it would be good to have this easily visible.
- processes: this is a list of "matrixHash"-ed (function above) of domDecay, slowDecay, slowMixing, domTurnover, bioTurnover, disturbanceMatrices.
