# Overview

The theme here is "Transparency, flexibility and science improvement in CFS carbon modelling". 

## Where we started from

In summer 2017 Scott Morken wrote a second incarnation of a CBM-like R-based carbon model in an intensive 2-week stint with EMcIntire and CBoisvenue. The code and scripts, including the calls to Cpp via RCpp, are all contained in RunSK_new.R. This emulates the science in CBM-CFS3 but works in matrix operations (the original CBM-CFS3 does not). Scott got a spin up working with a comparison for 1 stand in SK, which he ran for 100 years post spin-up in both CBMCFS3 and the script as developed here. Results are the same compared to classic CBMCFS3 (see C:\Celine\GitHub\RCBM\data\12_Spades_run\CBM3BaselineTesting). A map of the links and functions of the R and cpp code (created by CBoisvenue) is avaible here (G:\RES_Work\Work\SpaDES\work\RCBMoverview\June2017CBMcore\cbmCoreMap.xlsx).

# Three-module family
One SpaDES module was developped to run the exact same script as RunSK-new.R. This SpaDES module is called carb1. A tagged version of it exists on the private github repo https://github.com/cboisvenue/RCBM.

The SpaDES module carb1 ("simple" rendition of RunSK_new.R into SapDES) was separated into three spadesCBM-family modules: spadesCBMdefaults, spadesCBMinputs, and spadesCBMcore. These are three child modules that are run by the present spadesCBM parent module. These are in the master branch here: https://github.com/cboisvenue/spadesCBM.git

The two first modules have a parsing file (the R file that has all the functions - spadesCBMdefaultFunctions.r, spadesCBMinputsFunctions.r). 
spadesCBMdefaultFunctions.r has r-language functions to build and query the S4 object cbmData. spadesCBMinputsFunctions.r, has r-language hashing functions and calls on the library "CBMVolumeToBiomass". This library was build by Scott Morken to apply the Boudewyn et al stand-level parameters to growth curve information for a translation into biomass pools. This library needs to be already built before running this module.
spadesCBMcoreFunctions.r compiles the Rcpp code in .InputObjects of spadesCBMcore.R (it has no parsing file). The compiled code is cached in the cache directory  `cacheDir = cachePath(sim), env = envir(sim)`

Many more details of this three-modules family are in G:\RES_Work\Work\SpaDES\spadesCBM\Prezi WIN spadesCBM modules ov.exe, which is also a working document.
