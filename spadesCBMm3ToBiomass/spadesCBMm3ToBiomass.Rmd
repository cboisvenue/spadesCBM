# Overview

This module translates the m3/ha values into the biomass/ha increments that spadesCBMcore needs to simulate annual carbon fluxes and estimate stocks in the spadesCBMcore.R module of the spadesCBM. The Boudewyn et al 2007 parameters are used for this stand-level translation. Like many statistical models, this translation is not always successful. This module provides one avenue of smoothgin models by fitting GAMs on the cumulative tonnes of carbon/ha for each abover ground carbon pools (merch, foliage, and other) per SW HW. **It is the responsibility of the user to decide if these curves and smoothing methods are appropriate.** 

## User input

The user must provide two files for the growth information and one location file: 
* one metadata file (userGcMeta) that has at a minimum an identifier that links each specific growth curve to a pixel on the study area raster (gcId) and the leading species for that curve.
* one file that gives the m3 per ha by age for each of the identified growth curves. 
* a location information. This information is preferably passed along as a raster from the spadesCBMinputs module, but that can be by-passed by providing a vector of the ecozones and spatial units the growth curves apply to. The information is used to identify the jurisdiction (province or territory) and the ecozone each gcId is in, which in turn are used to determine the appropriate parameters for the stand-level conversion from m3/ha to biomass per ha in the Boudewyn et al. approach.

## Default files provided

Two types of information are built in to this module: Boudewyn et al. parameters tables, and data frames to help link CBM-specific information and parameter categories. 
* URLs to the Boudewyn et al. five parameter tables are built into this module and will be loaded from the NFIS site directly.
* the cbmAdmin data frame links CBM-specific spatial units to administrative boundaries in Canada and ecozones.
* the canfi_species data frame provides the canfi_species numbers and genus abbreviations used to identify the correct parameters in Boudewyn et al tables. This also specifies a name for each tree species and the forest_type_id, which is an identifier used in CBM.

## Pseudocode: the general steps

This module reads in the user userGcMeta, then reads in the userGcM3. It provides a plot of all the curves in userGcM3 for visual inspection (`sim$volCurves`). It then matches the jurisdiction with each gcId, and matches the leading species attaching a canfi_species and a genus to each leading species. canfi_species and genus are key to associating the correct parameters for conversion (Boudewyn et al. 2007). Once all the species matches are complete, a series of functions (see spadesCBMm3ToBiomassFunctions.R) are used to go from the provided cumulative m3/ha for each curve into cumulative tonnes of c/ha for each above ground live biomass pool (merch, foliage, other). A visual check is provided via `sim$plotsRawCumulativeBiomass`. Since most of the time these models need smoothing, an example of smoothing is provided by fitting GAMs to each of the cumulative curve (per gcId) for each pool (3). In this example, the default knots for the GAMs are set at 20 (k=20) and extra weight is given to the 0 intercept and the maximum value of each curve by setting weights (wts in the script). Again, **it is the user's responsibility to decided in smoothing parameters and/or methods are appropriate**. The default example, fitted values of the cumulative carbon curves are used to calculate annual increment, which are then dived by two for use in the spadesCBMcore.R module annual processing. Halved increments can be visually assessed using `sim$checkInc` and the halved increments themselves are save in the simList (`sim$growth_increments`). In a final step, the halved growth increment table if hashed for processing speed in the annual event of the spadesCBMcore.R module. This module uses an example from a region in Saskatchewan as an example and can be modified to run independently (i.e., just for translation of m3 to above ground carbon in the three pools).

##Units

The user provides growth curves in m3/ha of cumulative m3/ha over time. Those curves are fed into the Boudewyn algorithms (spadesCBMm3ToBiomass module) with its results multiplied by 0.5 to give carbon. This family of module simulates on an annual basis and it is preferable that the cumulative curves of m3/ha be provided over individual years. If these are not per individual years, the GAM fitted values should be modified to provide yearly fitted.values. The object cumPoolsRaw, line 365 in spadesCBMinputs, is the cumulative values for each of the three above-ground live pools in tonnes of carbon/ha. All following values are in tonnes of c/ha.


##Output

This module provides the `sim$growth_increments` and its hashed version, ` sim$gcHash` available for the spadesCBMcore module. All other output created by this module is for visual checks of the growth curve themselves and their processing.

##SpaDES

There is only one event in this module (init), and this module is only scheduled once. This module is designed to be part of the family of modules representing CBM-CFS3 in spades. There are four modules in this family: spadesCBMdefaults, spadesSBMinputs, spadesCBMm3ToBiomass, and spadesCBMcore.

##list of potential improvements

* add a check to see if the growth curves provided are on an annual basis and if not, modify the GAM outputs to provided and annual fitted value.
* make k (knots in the GAMs) a user defined parameter
* provide an option to fit a GAM prior to the maximum value of each curve (from 0 to max) with its own number of knots (k) and one for after the maximum value with possibly few knots.
* same as previous but for the weights going into the GAMs.
